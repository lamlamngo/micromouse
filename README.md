# micromouse-arduino
Arduino based micro-mouse to traverse 16x16 mazes. Competed at the Brown Robotics Olympiad 2017 (4th place technically)

Built with an Arduino Uno, A4990 Driver Shield. PID controller and flood-fill algorithm. 

Will be updated later this year when I compete at the Brown Robotics Olympiad 2018. 

To use, don't forget to import all the needed libraries.
